Image Processing</h1>

As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I chose to take the Image Processing course.

This repository contains a series of projects focused on various advanced image processing techniques. Each project explores a specific topic, ranging from hybrid image creation and image blending to more complex tasks like image restoration using GANs. Below is a brief overview of each exercise.
