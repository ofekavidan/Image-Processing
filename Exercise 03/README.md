# Image Processing - Hybrid Image Creation and Image Blending Using Pyramids

Project Overview

This project explores techniques for image blending and hybrid image creation using frequency domain manipulations. Two primary methods are implemented:


Hybrid Image Creation: Combines two images into one, where different features are visible from different viewing distances, using Gaussian filtering for low and high-frequency components.

Pyramid Image Blending: Uses Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids to smoothly blend two images together with controlled transitions.

Key Techniques:

Gaussian Filtering: Used to extract low-frequency components from one image and high-frequency components from another for hybrid image creation.

Pyramidal Blending: Combines images by building Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids and blending them based on a mask.
