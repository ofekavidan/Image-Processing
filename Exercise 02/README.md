# Audio Noise Removal Using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

Project Overview

This project implements techniques for noise detection and removal from audio files using frequency analysis. The main tools utilized include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Two different algorithms are applied to remove noise based on the characteristics of the audio signals provided.

Key Techniques:

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Used to analyze the frequency components of the audio in the first task.

Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT): Applied in the second task to analyze and remove noise in non-stationary signals by processing the audio in time windows.

Masking: Noise components are identified and set to zero to remove unwanted frequencies from the audio.
